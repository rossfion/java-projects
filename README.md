Repository for all of my Java projects
Java is a programming language I have always wanted to learn - since the 1990s!
The current repository kicks off with projects I have completed on Udemy. I am following Timothy Short's tutorial, "Become a Junior Java Software Developer".
The course uses the Eclipse IDE. However, given the age of my machine, I have chosen to use Notepad++. The latest JDK is 18.0.1 (from OpenJDK). 
It still works even though the course is about five years old.
